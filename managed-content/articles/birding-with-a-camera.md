When I was researching a camera to try bird photography, guides were all over the map. It was not clear if I could even
reasonably start out below 5000 dollars. Would I regret buying a sub-2000 dollar rig because the photos would be so
obviously amateur?

Super-zooms are a great choice for arguably *most* birders - especially new ones. I'll make an argument for and against them and then give you some recommendations on what to buy.

## Why Super-zoom Bridge Cameras Excel

These cameras do not take National Geographic quality photos - most of the time. In perfect conditions, you will get some really nice shots. You'll definitely get great shots for web or social media use.

Since you can take them anywhere without special planning, they're perfect for a birder that enjoys hiking and has some interest in getting photos. Here's a rundown of the key reasons to pick one of these up:

#### Zoom
First and definitely foremost for birding, super-zoom cameras have  incredible zoom. Any of these cameras have over 1000mm zoom lenses which is practically unrivaled at any price or size in detachable lenses.

#### Size
A bridge camera has a permanently attached lens which allows the camera to be significantly more compact. Furthermore, they have tiny sensors which increases the zoom power of small lenses. Most of these cameras can fit alongside your hiking gear with very little fuss, making it easy to get serendipitous shots while you're in the field.

#### Price
Depending on your budget, this could be a deciding factor. A birding capable super-zoom will range from 300 to 1200 dollars brand new - not to mentioned used. A new rig that you would be happy birding with in the full camera body + lens world would generally *start* at 1200 and easily pass 2000, unless you go used, old, or cheap.

## When to go for a Full Camera Body Instead

In the field, it seems that the vast majority of bird photographers go with a full camera body and lens combo. It is far and away the most common advice if you look around for 'best birding camera.' This advice is certainly not wrong - super-zooms are not the *best* camera in terms of the photos you get.

Full camera bodies can get much more precise focus and markedly better photo quality in most cases than a super-zoom. The tradeoffs are size and budget. The full setup is going to be either more expensive and larger, much much more expensive and still slightly bigger, or in the same ballpark and not quite as powerful as you need for birds.

To get the really crisp, professional shots of birds perched nicely on a branch, you will almost definitely have to spend a lot of time in one spot behind a $2k+ huge lens. That is still definitely a great time and super rewarding, and I encourage you to go all in if that's what you're after!

So, I would advise you to get a full camera body for a few different reasons. If you are sure you want to get into professional photography, it's a good investment and probably better than a super-zoom due to the quality difference. Also, if you aren't very mobile or don't plan to hike, a nice tripod setup could be enjoyable. Finally, if the sky is the limit on your budget there are excellent medium size telephoto rigs to be had for a price. For further reading, check out this [a great article on
B&H that discusses lenses in general](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/guide-birding-long-lenses).

However, in an effort to make birding as approachable as possible for everyone, I think the price alone of super-zooms is a game changer. As an added bonus, because of the price point, you can have a super-zoom for long hikes and pick up a bigger rig for calculated photography outings.

## Recommended Super-zoom Cameras

These are the best super-zoom bridge cameras currently available at a few different price points. I really think any one
of these are great starter cameras for an aspiring birder. They retain value even if you decide to later upgrade because 
they're quite compact - you can take these anywhere without lugging your larger rig.

#### Best Overall <br/> Cannon Powershot SX70 HS <br/> $600

This is an excellent combination of value and performance. At about 600 dollars, it fits in the middle of this set of
devices. The 1365mm 35m equivalent zoom will reach birds in any reasonable situation.

It is sufficient but weak in low-light situations, however, with a max ISO of 800 in auto mode you will have noticeable
grain in most low light situations.

This is my go-to starter camera. It's relatively small size make it great as a backup for travel as well.

#### Most Powerful <br/> Nikon Coolpix P950 <br/> $799.95

The P950 is the best super-zoom on the market, but also one of the most expensive. This is the newest in the Nikon P range, coming out after the P1000. At a lower price point, I think the P950 is a more realistic camera than the practically tech-demo P1000. A detachable lens with equivalent zoom to either may not even exist and if it did it would easily cost six figures!

At 2000mm zoom, you are very unlikely to get in a situation where you miss a shot of a bird in the field. It's the largest camera of this set by a fair amount, but still considerably smaller
than a full body + lens.

### Best Value <br/> Panasonic Lumix FZ80 <br /> $400

This is a very capable camera especially at this price. I think the extra zoom and improved build quality
of the SX70 is what sets the two apart, but if your primary consideration is cost then the FZ80 is a great choice.

Some advantages the Lumix seems to have over the SX70 is slightly better low-light performance and a lot more AF points.

It's great to have something at this price point that can make bird photography more accessible to almost everyone.

## Where to go next

Once you've picked up a camera, you're going to want to figure out what all the settings do. Don't be afraid to go out
and shoot some birds in Auto mode for a while to get a feel for your camera and tracking birds in general. I found a lot
of 'magic sauce' sort of advice online but really nothing beats practice. The best thing you can do is take
as many photos as you can in as many situations as you're able to.

Furthermore, whatever camera you have is 'the right camera.' Being able to take photos at all is half the battle here
and you can absolutely make good, memorable, photos with almost any camera. Remember to be comfortable with whatever you get
and focus on learning the ways your camera can take interesting photos.

Once you have your camera, I highly recommend
[this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exposure-photography) (you can audit for free!). This course
will give you an introduction to the basics of photography and explains most terms and camera features pretty simply.
