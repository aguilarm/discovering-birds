Whether you're planning a trip to North America or have lived there your entire life, the sheer number
of really great birds can be difficult to sort out. Further, once you move past Hummingbirds, Blue Jays and
Cardinals you may need to spend some time with a field guide to know what else to look for.
With this short guide, I am hoping to get you excited for a road trip. 
However, it's just as likely you'll be able to experience some of these birds across much of the continent.
