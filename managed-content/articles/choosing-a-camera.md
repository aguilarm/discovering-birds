Photographing birds is a lot of fun, and I want to make it easier for other people to enjoy this hobby 
without getting decision overload right off the bat. I'm creating this guide to get you set up for birding quickly 
with between 300-1000 dollars.

When I was researching a camera to try bird photography, guides were all over the map. It was not clear if I could even
reasonably start out below 5000 dollars. Would I regret buying a sub-2000 dollar rig because the photos would be so
obviously amateur?

For a hobbyist photographer there is little to regret with these cameras.
You will get excellent shots for social media, better bird IDs, and general web use. In perfect conditions, you can get surprisingly
good shots. These cameras are also incredibly compact compared to the gear required for equivalent zoom on a professional 
rig. The price point can get you started without a massive impact on your wallet as well.

## Key Features for Bird Photography

First, you'll want to be familiar with what features to look for in a camera you intend to use for bird photography.

### 1. Zoom
In my experience, zoom is the most important feature you want to be sure to upgrade for bird photography.
Birds are generally very small targets that aren't terribly keen on humans being near them,
so you'll need to be able to capture small objects from a considerable distance.

### 2. Autofocus
In addition to being small and distant, birds are very quick and their movement can be unpredictable. To get sharp photos
of birds you need a powerful autofocus system. You will want *fast* AF. Multiple points are not especially useful with birds.

### 3. Shutter Speed
A fast shutter means you can take photos in quick succession, as soon as you can. This makes it easy to capture birds in-flight and prevents
you from missing out on good shots before the bird moves again.

### 4. High ISO
ISO is a measurement of light sensitivity. A high ISO means you can take photos in much lower ambient light without
getting grainy results. You'll *need* something that can handle at least 800 ISO. At 800 ISO you aren't going to get
truly great shots if the sun isn't mostly out, so it is prudent to weigh this pretty high.

### 5. Size
For field photography, I think size is an important consideration. A small camera is easy to take wherever you go and allows
you to be nimble as you track birds down. It seems there is a sort of 'small, cheap, powerful - pick two' rule with camera
equipment - you can gain a lot of power if you get a huge rig.

## The Cameras

These are the best superzoom bridge cammeras currently available at a few different price points. I really think any one
of these are great starter cameras for an aspiring birder. They retain value even if you decide to later upgrade because 
they're quite compact - you can take these anywhere without lugging your larger rig.

### Best Overall <br/> Cannon Powershot SX70 HS

#### $600
1. Zoom 4/5
2. Autofocus 4/5
3. Shutter Speed 4/5
4. ISO 3/5
5. Size 5/5


This is an excellent combination of value and performance. At about 600 dollars, it fits in the middle of this set of
devices. The 1365mm 35m equivalent zoom will reach birds in any reasonable situation.

It is sufficient but weak in low-light situations, however, with a max ISO of 800 in auto mode you will have noticeable
grain in most low light situations.

This is my go-to starter camera. It's relatively small size make it great as a backup for travel as well.

### Most Powerful <br/> Nikon Coolpix P1000

#### $999.95
1. Zoom 5/5
3. Autofocus 3/5
4. Shutter Speed 3/5
2. ISO 4/5
5. Size 3/5


The P1000 is what you should get if money is not an issue. This camera's price nearly tips into the full body + lens range
but at just shy of $1k is still decent value. A detachable lens with equivalent zoom may not even exist and if it did it
would easily cost six figures!

The zoom ability of this camera is nothing short of incredible - there will be very few situations where a bird is too
far away for you to get a decent shot. It's the largest camera of this set by a fair amount, but still considerably smaller
than a full body + lens.

Also consider the rest of the P range. The newer P950 costs even more but actually has more practical specs and is really 
a better camera despite the lower zoom.

### Best Value <br/> Panasonic Lumix FZ80

#### $400 (often >$300 on sale)
1. Zoom 3/5
3. Autofocus 4/5
4. Shutter Speed 4/5
2. ISO 4/5
5. Size 5/5


This is a very capable camera especially at this price. I think the extra zoom and improved build quality
of the SX70 is what sets the two apart, but if your primary consideration is cost then the FZ80 is a great choice.

Some advantages the Lumix seems to have over the SX70 is slightly better low-light performance and a lot more AF points.

It's great to have something at this price point that can make bird photography more accessible to almost everyone.

## Where to go next

Once you've picked up a camera, you're going to want to figure out what all the settings do. Don't be afraid to go out
and shoot some birds in Auto mode for a while to get a feel for your camera and tracking birds in general. I found a lot
of 'magic sauce' sort of advice online but really nothing beats practice. The best thing you can do is take
as many photos as you can in as many situations as you're able to.

Furthermore, whatever camera you have is 'the right camera.' Being able to take photos at all is half the battle here
and you can absolutely make good, memorable, photos with almost any camera. Remember to be comfortable with whatever you get
and focus on learning the ways your camera can take interesting photos.

Once you have your camera, I highly recommend
[this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exposure-photography) (you can audit for free!). This course
will give you an introduction to the basics of photography and explains most terms and camera features pretty simply.

I've recommended super-zoom bridge cameras which are almost exclusively built for amateurs and hobbyists. 
If you want to jump right into full camera bodies, there is [a great article on
B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/guide-birding-long-lenses) that covers this with
more of a lean towards professional level gear. It gives a more in-depth overview of the actual features of lenses
and compares them to binoculars.
