Central Texas is one of the country's best places to go birding. In the Spring and Fall, the area is host to an incredible amount of migratory birds funnelling through the Central Flyway. You can find lots of varied environments from woodlands to prairies along with several lakes and rivers.

If you are planning a trip or have lived in Central Texas for a while and are interested in birding, I'll give you my top five places to find excellent birds.

## 1. Hornsby Bend Bird Observatory

A Central Teas trip is not complete without a visit to the Hornsby Bend Bird Observatory. This is part of the Austin Water system and includes various ponds related to water treatment and research. These ponds have a tendency to attract vagrant migratory shorebirds and make Hornsby one of the best places to find aquatic birds in the area. 

Hornsby is not particularly difficult terrain, but you may need to do a bit of walking to get around. You can participate in a handful of monthly group bird walks or visit on your own. The bird walks guarantee 50 species an outing, which is pretty impressive as a consistent count!

## 2. Commons Ford Ranch

Commons Ford hosts a vast prairie land and runs along the Colorado River. It's a great place to find Painted Buntings in the summer and migratory songbirds in the fall and spring.

The terrain is varied but mostly forgiving. Travis County Audubon normally hosts a few outings here a month.

## 3. Balcones Canyonlands Doeskin Ranch

For summer birding, it's difficult to beat Doeskin Ranch. Host to the two arguably must-see Central Texas birds - the Black-Capped Vireo and Golden-cheeked Warblers - Doeskin Ranch is a good place to see all sorts of interesting birds. I have found Northern Bobwhites, Woodhouse's Scrub Jays, and Blue Grosbeaks here.

While you can see quite a bit from flat, easy paths near the parking lot you will need to hike a sizable hill to get to the meat and potatoes of this park. Also note that it is quite a drive to get there and there is not a lot nearby so prepare accordingly.

## 4. Saint Edwards Park

St Ed's park (not the university) has a nice mix of open grasslands, cedar forest, and larger oak forest. It runs along a medium-sized part of Bull Creek. This combination of environments makes it an excellent place to catch migratory birds - you can find 100s of Cedar Waxwings in Spring. It's also a breeding area for Golden-Cheeked Warblers in the late Spring and early Summer.

The terrain can be a little rough, and the trail is sometimes not especially well-marked. Parking is also incredibly limited and people report occasional smash-and-grabs. However, if you prepare by taking sturdy boots, don't leave anything in your vehicle, and get there before 7:30am, it's worth the trouble!

## 5. Pace Bend Park

Rounding things off with a visit to Lake Travis, you will have an opportunity for more aquatic birds and plenty of song birds. This is also a good place to find Scissor-tailed Flycatchers.

Pace Bend has relatively easy trails, and you can have a great day staying put by the water in the day-use area. Entry is (as of writing) $5/person and **cash only**. You can also camp here, and it's absolutely worth it if you can snag a spot.
