Central Texas is one of the country's best places to go birding. In the Spring and Fall, the area is host to an incredible amount of migratory birds funnelling through the Central Flyway. You can find lots of varied environments from woodlands to prairies along with several lakes and rivers.

If you are planning a trip or have lived in Central Texas for a while and are interested in birding, here are a few places to find excellent birds.


## Balcones Canyonlands Doeskin Ranch

For summer birding, it's difficult to beat Doeskin Ranch. Host to the two arguably must-see Central Texas birds - the Black-Capped Vireo and Golden-cheeked Warblers - Doeskin Ranch is a good place to see all sorts of interesting birds. I have found Northern Bobwhites, Woodhouse's Scrub Jays, and Blue Grosbeaks here.

While you can see quite a bit from flat, easy paths near the parking lot you will need to hike a sizable hill to get to the meat and potatoes of this park. Also note that it is quite a drive to get there and there is not a lot nearby so prepare accordingly.

## Mill's Pond

Mill's pond is Austin's best urban migrant hub. There is a relatively large pond and a nice chunk of wetland forested area. During spring and fall migration, you can find a ton of migrating warblers, waterthrush, and more. You'll also likely encounter a handful of other birders to share your experience with.

This is a mostly paved or otherwise improved large city park that is easy to walk and has plenty of places to park and enter. There will be a fair amount of foot traffic from folks living nearby but that does not generally phase the birds.

## Pace Bend Park

Taking a visit to Lake Travis, you will have an opportunity for more aquatic birds and plenty of song birds. This is also a good place to find Scissor-tailed Flycatchers.

Pace Bend has relatively easy trails, and you can have a great day staying put by the water in the day-use area. Entry is (as of writing) $5/person and **cash only**. You can also camp here, and it's absolutely worth it if you can snag a spot.

## Saint Edwards Park

St Ed's park has a nice mix of open grasslands, cedar forest, and larger oak forest. It runs along a medium-sized part of Bull Creek. This combination of environments makes it an excellent place to catch migratory birds - you can find 100s of Cedar Waxwings in Spring. It's also a breeding area for Golden-Cheeked Warblers in the late Spring and early Summer.

The terrain can be a little rough, and the trail is sometimes not especially well-marked. Parking is also limited, and you may need to park on the street. However, if you prepare by taking sturdy boots and get there before ~7:30am, it's worth the trouble!
